    and 21st-century pottery tradition developed by the Puebloan Native American
    ceramic artists in Northern New Mexico. Traditional reduction-fired blackware
    has been made for centuries by pueblo artists. Black-on-black ware of the past
    century is produced with a smooth surface, with the designs applied through selective
    burnishing or the application of refractory slip. Another style involves carving
    or incising designs and selectively polishing the raised areas. For generations
    several families from Kha'po Owingeh and P'ohwh\xF3ge Owingeh pueblos have been
    making black-on-black ware with the techniques passed down from matriarch potters.
    Artists from other pueblos have also produced black-on-black ware. Several contemporary
    artists have created works honoring the pottery of their ancestors."
