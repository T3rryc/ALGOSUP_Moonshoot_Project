  initialPrompt: 'A table summarizing the fruits from Goocrux:


    There are many
    fruits that were found on the recently discovered planet Goocrux. There are neoskizzles
    that grow there, which are purple and taste like candy. There are also loheckles,
    which are a grayish blue fruit and are very tart, a little bit like a lemon.
    Pounits are a bright green color and are more savory than sweet. There are also
    plenty of loopnovas which are a neon pink flavor and taste like cotton candy.
    Finally, there are fruits called glowls, which have a very sour and bitter taste
    which is acidic and caustic, and a pale orange tinge to them.
