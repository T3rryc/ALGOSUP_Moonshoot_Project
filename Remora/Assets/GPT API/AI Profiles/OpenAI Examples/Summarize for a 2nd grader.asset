    Jupiter is the
    fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant
    with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of
    all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest
    objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient
    civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god
    Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected
    light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest natural
    object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.'
