  initialPrompt: 'A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star,
    which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the
    star was especially metal-rich.[1] Neutron stars are the smallest and densest
    stellar objects, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars,
    and strange stars.[2] Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres
    (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.[3] They result from the supernova
    explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses
    the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.
