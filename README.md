Moonshot Project Algosup

VR technology is one the most developing sectors over all, even though this technology existed for a long time ago.
Some games in VR adapted some kind of game like shooter, simulation, rhythm game and even open world.
But few VR games adapted actually fighting and platformer games.
There doesn't already exist a VR game with the principle to eject someone “out of the ring”.  
Some VR games have a limited movement possibility and lack of option to feel what the player does or gets.
Salty Project is a VR game based on a platformer fighting game but closer to a grappling game. To win the game, the player must eject the opponent out of a delimited area with a lot of options to do this.
Like all platformer fighting games, the knockback growth depande how many hits you received.  
In addition to the VR headset, the game integrates a VR suit to feel more deeply the interaction like you are it.
This project uses the Unity game engine.
