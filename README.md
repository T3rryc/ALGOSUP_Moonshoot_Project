Moonshot Project Algosup

VR technology is one the most developing sectors over all, even though this technology existed for a long time ago.<br>
Some games in VR adapted some kind of game like shooter, simulation, rhythm game and even open world.<br>
But few VR games adapted actually fighting and platformer games.<br>
There doesn't already exist a VR game with the principle to eject someone “out of the ring”.<br> 
Some VR games have a limited movement possibility and lack of option to feel what the player does or gets.<br>
Salty Project is a VR game based on a platformer fighting game but closer to a grappling game.<br>
To win the game, the player must eject the opponent out of a delimited area with a lot of options to do this.<br>
Like all platformer fighting games, the knockback growth depande how many hits you received.<br>
In addition to the VR headset, the game integrates a VR suit to feel more deeply the interaction like you are it.<br>
This project uses the Unity game engine.<br>
